My skill sets, interests, and goals all fit well with the postdoc opening at the University of Minnesota. On one hand, I have a strong interest for the FAIR4HEP project, AI/machine learning and open data. On the other side, I am motivated to continue to test the standard model or search for beyond the standard model physics and lead  physics analyses. 

I am also strongly motivated to expand my leadership skills and responsibilities within the CMS organization, and I would love the chance to take on a leadership role of a DPG, POG or PAG group.


In the next few pages, I've highlighted some aspects of my current research. 

\section{BFF Z'}

My dissertation focuses on the search for a novel Z' candidate motivated by the recent discrepancy between standard model predicted and observed branching fractions of leptonic B meson decays to muons versus electrons noted at the lHCb ($R_K$ and $R_{K^{*}}$). The anomaly in $R_K$ and $R_{K^{*}}$ ,combined with Belle's measurements, nears 4$\sigma$\cite{rkStar}. This hint of lepton non-universality can be explained by the addition of a Z' particle which features a flavour changing $\delta_{bs}$ interaction, no coupling with lighter quarks, and no decay to first generation leptons. Because of it's unique couplings, we can search for the particle in conjunction with associated b-jets and probe lower mass points than other Z' analyses. 

Our search strategy is based on the strategy laid out in Abdullah et al. \cite{PhysRevD.97.075035}, tuned and re-optimized for 2016-2018 data from the CMS experiment. Possible production mechanisms of our Z' candidate include a standard s-channel process, as well as one and two associated b-jet cases. The first order s-channel process in our model is covered in the inclusive Z' search, and a specialized search will not exclude extra phase space. However, Z' production in association with an ISR b-jet provides us with an additional handle to observe low mass Z's with greater sensitivity. The second shown final state in Figure \ref{fig:z_prime_cases} is dubbed "Bottom Fermion Fusion", in analogy to Vector Boson Fusion.

My dissertation focuses on the muonic decay of the Z'. Selecting for events containing dilepton ($e$ and $\mu$) pairs, low missing $E_T$, and at least one jet, we divide out sample into one and two jet, b-tagged and anti-btagged, and lepton permutation ($ee$, $e\mu$, $\mu\mu$) bins. We then employ three kinematic cuts to increase our significance: A $MET/M_{\ell\ell}$ (aka relative MET) filter takes advantage of the low transverse MET and high mass lepton pairs of the signal. Filtering on the difference between the hadronic transverse energy and letponic transverse energy (HT-LT) takes advantage of the fact that our associated b-jets tend to be "soft", or low energy. Finally, we permute the b-jets and leptons to create a best-guess top quark decay and compute it's mass (Top Mass Bound) to exclude top quarks from the final events. Cut values on these variables are optimized in monte-carlo simulation, and HT-LT and relative met cuts are optimized for variable mass points. Finally, an ABCD method is used to create a data driven background estimation, where we use electron vs muon and b-tagged vs anti-b-tagged regions to define our control and background regions. 

We are currently setting limits and finishing our analysis note. 

\section{Muon Alignment}

 Track based muon alignment is a critical alignment and calibration task at CMS. The alignment team is responsible for delivering up-to-date conditions of the positions of the muon detectors, ensuring the muon system is operating optimally, and developing further improvements to the muon alignment algorithm. I have contributed to all aspects of track based muon alignment since joining CMS in 2014, from delivering conditions under tight deadlines to ensuring proper data integrity, leading group and inter-group investigations, teaching and guiding new members of muon alignment, and developing new software for the track based muon alignment group based on modern programing practices and tools.
 
%Some examples of my contributions include working with other members of the team to upgrade muon alignment in the DTs from 3 to 6 degrees of freedom, upgrading our alignment validation code to function modularly and significantly more efficiently, leading multiple investigations into unexpected features in alignment, leading a study to measure overall systematic and statistical uncertainties, creating a simplified standalone monte-carlo simulation of the muon alignment algorithm for educational purposes and for directed investigations into hard to investigate systematics, branching the toy mc simulation of muon alignment into a project for a new student, helping guide development of GEM alignment, upgrading alignment software, representing the Muon Alignment group at AlcaDB/DPG meetings and much more. Our work in recent years is currently being summarized in a new Muon Alignment note. I will bring my leadership and innovation demonstrated by my work in muon alignment to future research. 
 
 
 \section{MonoTop}
 
 Exotic particle decays (e.g. certain non-thermal dark matter models) can result in single top production with right chirality at the LHC. Since standard model single top production results in mostly left-chiral tops, if we can measure the chirality of the top quark, we can gain a better handle on these processes. However, traditional top chirality measurements are designed to work with $t\bar{t}$ events and leverage correlations between the top quark decay products to measure chirality. e.g. the angle between the lepton angles of both pair-produced top quarks. At A\&M, we developed a simple single top observable to measure chirality in an event agnostic manner.
 
Our measurable relies on the relative energy difference a single top quark's daughter particles, allowing it to function independently of the top quark production mechanism. This not only makes it useful for our monotop search, but also as a general technique that could be applied to many top based analysis (e.g. precision standard model measurements). 

\section{Trajectory}


I am excited about the potential to work with the University of Minnesota's CMS group, work with computer and data scientists, contribute to the FAIR4HEP project, and continue to develop my physics, technical, data science, and leadership skills. I believe this postdoc would help me develop into a researcher that can contribute to a new generation of physics research and open doors in AI and data science for me.
