To the Search Committee: 

I am writing to apply for the CMS postdoctoral position offered by the University of Minnesota in Nadja Strobbe’s group. I am currently a graduate student at Texas A\&M University working on my dissertation under Teruki Kamon, focusing in exotic particle searches and muon physics at CMS. My dissertation is expected to be completed by December 2020. At Texas A\&M, I have developed my physics analysis, programming, and leadership skills through my dissertation work, service work, and phenomenology projects.  I believe my background makes me well suited for this position, and the opportunities provided by the position will enable me to further my career goals. 

My dissertation focuses on the search for a novel Z' candidate through “Bottom Fermion Fusion”. Motivated by a promising explanation of the potential observation of lepton non-universality in the LHCb’s measure of $R_{K}$ and $R_{K^*}$, we look for a flavor changing Z' produced in conjunction with b-jets. These associated b-jets allow us to probe lower mass regions than the vanilla inclusive Z' search. In this work, I've coordinated and collaborated with intuitions across the CMS collaboration, developed analysis software, managed POG recommendations, optimized event selection and analysis strategy, produced skims, figures of merit and all the other tasks needed to complete a CMS analysis. Beyond my dissertation, I've had the opportunity to work on a phenomenology project, developing a final state agnostic method to measure top quark chirality to better detect some non-thermal dark matter models, and have helped mentor and show younger grad students the ropes. I'm excited at the prospect of bringing my analysis and technical skills to Minnesota and continuing my work searching for new physics in CMS. 


As a member of the Track Based Muon Alignment team at Texas A\&M, I've had the opportunity to build relationships within CMS, guide and educate fellow graduate students and undergraduate students through complex projects and work with the technical aspects of the CMS muons system. To focus on my mentorship in the last year, I have worked extensively with two graduate students and one undergraduate student, both teaching them the skills they would need, and guiding them to the successful completion of tasks. Hands on leadership and mentorship has been crucial for training the next generation of grad students and accomplishing tasks effectively. For example, I meet weekly with one of our younger students, monitoring his progress, introducing him to new concepts as he is ready, and pointing him in the right direction. I have also worked as the face of the Muon Alignment group, provided critical updates at AlcaDB, and helping lead inter-group cooperation and studies between the muon alignment and tracker alignment team. My experience here is perfect preparation to help guide graduate students and represent the University of Minnesota as a postdoc in the CMS organization. 

During my stint as the LPC Distinguished Graduate Student at Fermilab, I was able to build connections with the USCMS community as a whole. Since then, I've kept active in the USCMS community, continuing to serve as a co-chair on the LPC Computing Discussion group and stayed active in other LPC activities. My connection with USCMS will be a valuable addition in my next position as a post doc. 

In addition, I have an interest and expertise in machine learning, and I would love to bring my skill to the University of Minnesota to help develop new machine learning tools.

%Finally in “Distinguishing Standard Model Extensions using Monotop Chirality at the LHC”, I helped develop a simple measurable to measure top quark chirality in a final state agnostic way.  Traditional measurement of top quark chirality was developed for ttbar measurements, and uses correlations between the leptons in both jets, requiring two top quark decays. Our novel method, inspired by a non-thermal monotop search, only uses the top quark decay products to measure the top quark chirality, allowing this method to be plug-and-play in any analysis with a top quark. For example, while the method was designed for an exotic particle search, it could easily be used in a standard model measurement paper. 

My interest in the University of Minnesota also goes beyond my professional interests. My partner lives in Duluth and is a faculty member at the University of Minnesota-Duluth in the College of Liberal Arts. I would be excited to continue my academic journey in Minnesota and join the broader University of Minnesota community as well. 

To conclude, the postdoctoral position in Nadja Strobbe’s group is an ideal fit for my research agenda and analysis skills. The potential to work in an up-and-coming group, leading graduate students and continuing my work searching for exotic physics at CMS is very appealing. Please do not hesitate to contact me at rmueller@physics.tamu.edu, or at (281)-415-5146 should you have any questions. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

%You should soon be receiving letters of recommendation from Teruki Kamon, XXX, and XXX.  Please do not hesitate to contact me at rmueller@physics.tamu.edu, or at (281)-415-5146 should you have any questions. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
